General Grammar
=================

- Data is/Data are
  - "For what it's worth, I can confidently say that this will probably be 
    the only time I ever write the word 'datum' in a Datablog post. Data as 
    a plural term may be the proper usage but language evolves and we want 
    to write in terms that everyone understands - and that don't seem ridiculous."
    — Rogers, Simon, "Data are or data is?", published 8 Jul 2012 on 
    _The Guardian\: Datablog_.
