General Grammar
=================

- Data is/Data are

..

  For what it's worth, I can confidently say that this will probably be 
  the only time I ever write the word 'datum' in a Datablog post. Data 
  as a plural term may be the proper usage but language evolves and we 
  want to write in terms that everyone understands - and that don't seem ridiculous.

Snippets
===============

- Operator associativity

  ..

    Consider the expression ``a ~ b ~ c``. If the operator ``~`` has 
    left associativity, this expression would be interpreted as 
    ``(a ~ b) ~ c``. If the operator has right associativity, 
    the expression would be interpreted as ``a ~ (b ~ c)``. 
    If the operator is non-associative, the expression might be a syntax error, 
    or it might have some special meaning. Some mathematical 
    operators have inherent associativity. For example, subtraction 
    and division, as used in conventional math notation, 
    are inherently left-associative. Addition and multiplication, 
    by contrast, are both left and right associative. 
    (e.g. ``(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)``).
