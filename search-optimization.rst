The work of SEO is never done, because trends come and go, users can change their behavior, and search engines evolve over time. Your job is to consider how changes will impact your site and what you need to do to continue to attract unpaid or organic traffic.
Here are 4 quick tips on how to stay up-to-date on search.

1: Learn how search engines work.

Many have blogs that offer updates on new features, algorithm changes and suggestions on how to better optimise your website.

2: Keep an eye on changes and monitor how they affect your website.

For instance, you might read that the major search engines made a change that improves users’ experience on mobile search results. If your website isn’t optimized for mobile devices, you’d probably want to update your website to be more mobile-friendly.

3: Find inspiration from other websites.

Do they offer free shipping? Are they active on social networks? Do they regularly update their website with photos? Adopt the practices that will work for your own business.

And finally, 4: Talk to your customers. They have the best insights on what content your site is missing, features that are needed, or products they are looking for. Even the way your customers describe your products can be a form of keyword research—they likely use those same terms to search.

Considerations when SEO keywording
===================================

First, frequency, or the number of times a word is searched for. Obviously, you want to include the terms that people search for most often in relation to your products. Just keep in mind that it may be difficult to differentiate your business on highly searched-for terms.
That brings us to our second consideration: Competition. If you have a large, established website, you may be able to appear on the search engine results for high-volume, highly competitive keywords, like fruit and veg.

But new sites have big opportunities too: if you’re just getting started, look for keywords that have a bit less competition.

Only a small number of keywords have very high search volume. But there’s a large number that have low search volume.

This is what’s called the “long tail” of SEO .

While the keyword strawberries might have a lot of competition, a term like get organic strawberries delivered in Brisbane would be an example of a long tail keyword that might give you more immediate SEO results.

Finally, and most importantly, the third consideration is relevance. The keywords you select should closely match what you actually offer. If someone comes to your site looking for strawberries but you only sell raspberries, they’re just going to leave.
